        You now have your application's credentials. However, you're not yet ready to call the Discord API. You need
        to convert your credentials into an <i>OAuth2 Access Token</i>. To do so, you need to send your first (!)
        request to Discord, and perform a <b>Client Credentials Grant</b>.
      </p>
      <p class='page-paragraph'>
        You'll need to prepare a <i>Basic authentication token</i>. To get it, you simply need to join your Client ID
        and your Client Secret with a colon (<code>client_id:client_secret</code>), and encode it as Base64. You now
        have a Basic authentication token! Now, let's convert it to a <i>Bearer access token</i>, which is what we're
        interested in.
      </p>
      <p class='page-paragraph'>
        The request body will be urlencoded for this specific endpoint. That's kind of an ugly format, but it's only
        for this endpoint, and you'll then be able to use neat JSON data. For now, you can just use the body used below,
        and check Discord's documentation if you want more info about what this body is about.
      </p>

      <ApiCallView
        method='POST'
        url='https://discord.com/api/v10/oauth2/token'
        token={{ type: 'Basic', token: basicToken }}
        callable={!!basicToken}

        isUrlEncoded
        requestData='grant_type=client_credentials&scope=applications.commands.update'

        responseView={Response}
        onResponse={(res) => setToken(res.access_token)}
      />

      <p class='page-paragraph'>
        The <i>access_token</i> is what will allow you to call the Discord API on behalf of your application. As with
        the Client Secret, make sure you treat it like a password!
      </p>
      <p class='page-paragraph'>
        Whenever this token expires, you'll simply have to generate a new one following the same steps.
      </p>
